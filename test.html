            Together we travel<br>ed a long and gl<br>orious way from broa<br>dcasting home videos of musicians during the lockdown to professional recording live concerts in the<br> best concert halls around the world with over 1<br>0 mln views. The Classic@Home platform has been in existence for 3 years, our audience now is more than 200K active users.
            <br>
Our results and your support give us the boos<br> for further development to keep our audience astonished. We want to grow in the way of researching creative processes, to do what others can’t. Today, we challenge our<br>selves and start a pilot project focused on turning classical music into film. It is a turning point to make an interpretation of classical masterpieces. And we are ready to open this “Pandora’s box” and create a debut film in the genre of the classical visual in the shortest period of time.

<br>
                <br>
New Classic@Home’s project called KADDISH is a music film <br>performance meant to be<br> a result of reflecting on world affairs in 2022. This is an anti-war statement, reminding the audience that history repeats itself in cycles. And unfortunately, we are now at that curl of the spiral where events are perceived in a surprisingly inverse way, where black is called white and up is called down. Humanity has already committed this fatal error in the past. And today we have to remember our past and face the truth about our present.
 <br>
KADDISH is conceived as a visualized spirit and atmosphere <br>of the 1st movement of the Symphony №21 “Kaddish” written by Miechislav Weinberg – Polish-born Jewish composer. His work is dedicated to the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Holocaust. The composer’s own destiny was tragic: he was the only one from his family who managed to escape alive from the occupied  Warsaw Ghetto. He was haunted by survivor syndrome all his life and consumed by an unbearable sense of guilt for being alive while his parents and beloved little sister died in the Trawniki concentration camp.
SUPPORT KADDISH<br>
KADDISH is supposed to be a short film in the audiovisual genre where historical authent<br>icity and fragmental emotions are found side by side. This is our debut in the movie genre and we are going “all-in”. That’s why your feedback is so important. Are you interested in this type of project, are you ready to support it? The crowdfunding campaign for KADDISH is open now, and with your support, we are bound to be successful!
 
We’ll keep you updated regularly about the filming process <br>and we always stay i<br>n touch if you want to share your thoughts about this film!

Sincerely,
Classic@Home team
